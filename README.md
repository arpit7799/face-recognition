# 🧠 Face Recognition System using OpenCV & Python

This project implements a **Face Recognition and Detection System** using `OpenCV`, `dlib`, and the `face_recognition` library.  
It can **detect, train, and recognize human faces** in real time — ideal for authentication systems, smart security, or attendance tracking.

## 🚀 Features

- 👁️ **Real-Time Face Detection** using your webcam  
- 🧬 **Face Recognition** using deep-learning-based encodings  
- 🧠 **Training Module** to register new faces dynamically  
- 💾 **Face Data Storage** in pickle files for faster recognition  
- 📸 **Dataset Handling** with auto-detection and labeling  
- 🧹 **Modular Codebase** — easily extendable for AI-based attendance, emotion detection, etc.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arpit7799/face-recognition.git
   cd face-recognition

2.	Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate    # On macOS/Linux
  venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows

3.	Install Dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4.	Run the Application
   python face_recognition_app.py

🧠 How It Works
	1.	Face Detection → Captures frames via webcam and detects faces using OpenCV.
	2.	Encoding Generation → Extracts unique 128-dimension encodings using face_recognition.
	3.	Training → Saves these encodings into face_encodings.pkl.
	4.	Recognition → Compares live frames with known encodings to identify faces.
