# 🧠 Face Recognition System using OpenCV & Python

This project implements a **Face Recognition and Detection System** using `OpenCV`, `dlib`, and the `face_recognition` library.  
It can **detect, train, and recognize human faces** in real time — ideal for authentication systems, smart security, or attendance tracking.
